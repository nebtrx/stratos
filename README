Stratos Framework is a framework for execute webbots. It's a way for write faster and easyly webbots inside a context which provides the common webbots operations.
This is the first stable version and next in future I will upload a set of webbot samples running over the framewrok. The framework was develop as an aid during the
 construcction of a webbot for comercial purposes in Cuba which has not released yet. For this reason the first commit has not a context to be tested, but for those
 with souls of entrepeneurs I'll give you a hint: Extend the lib/scraper/Webbot.class.php in the bot directory and check the script/launcher.php.
